# ClassicHealingAssignments

## 1. What is Classic Healing Assignments?
Classic Healing Assignments (CHA) let you assign Healers in a raid to Tanks or Raid markers, and post the assignments in the Raid channel (or a healer channel if you like).


### 1.1. How do I use it?
Open the CHA user interface by left-clicking on the CHA minimap icon.

You can now create a new Template, and add wanted tank(s) plus healer(s).

See a Template as a Boss fight: one template for one boss.

For example:
Lucifron might require 3 tanks, so you'll make a template with 3 tanks, each having one healer assigned.

Ragnaros might only require one tank, but you also need Melee healers, so in this case you will add two tanks: one main tank, and one Custom tank you can name "Melee".

When your assignments are ready, you can right-click the minimap icon to post the assignments to Raid chat.
